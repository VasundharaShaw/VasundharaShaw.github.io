    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Hiya! I'm Vasundhara Shaw, I go by Vasu, currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in astrophysics at the University of Manchester.</p>

    <p>My work focuses on the intersection of topics high energy physics like cosmic rays, the Galactic magnetic field, and radio astronomy — especially using data from surveys like <a href="https://cbass.web.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">C-BASS</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/inaf.it/spass" target="_blank">S-PASS</a>. 
    I also build simulations to study how ultra-high energy cosmic rays might travel through the Galaxy, using tools like <a href="https://crpropa.github.io/CRPropa3/pages/Installation.html" target="_blank">CRPropa3</a>.</p>

    <p>I enjoy working with code, data, and big sky maps. Along the way, I’ve been lucky to collaborate with great people through projects like POSSUM, and to contribute to both research papers and open-source tools.</p>

    <p>Before this, I completed my PhD at DESY in Germany, where I started diving into cosmic ray transport and the structure of the Galactic halo. I try to balance the technical and collaborative sides of science, and I'm always open to learning more.</p>

    <p>Outside research, I care about mentoring, equity in science, and occasionally help out with outreach or student support initiatives.</p>

    <p>If you’re curious about my work or want to connect, feel free to browse around the site or get in touch.</p>
